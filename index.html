                <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Income, Age, & Poverty</h2>
                <p>The highest rates of obesity are in the states with the lowest median income levels, around $40,000 of annual household income. Upon visual inspection, there appears to be a negative correlation between rates of obesity and median household income. State obesity rates over 30% have been observed in those states whose median age is between 30 and 42. The correlation between obesity and age is much weaker than the one observed between obesity and income. Similar to the pattern seen with median income, there appears to be a positive correlation between the rate of obesity and the percent of a state's population that are in poverty.</p>
      
                <p>Overall, Colorado, Hawaii, and Washington DC have the lowest rates of obesity, in the 21%-22% range. The highest obesity percentages were 34%-36%. These rates were found in Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Louisiana.</p>
